        Created under the auspices of INCCA (Independent Network for
        Contemporary Culture & Art), this interactive map was a project I led —
        conducting the initial research and designing and developing the
        platform using React and Three.js. It draws on findings from the 2024
        Inclusive Economies Programme, a collaboration between the Gauteng
        City-Region Observatory (GCRO) and the Gauteng Department of Economic
        Development. The map visualises the diverse supportive infrastructure of
        the cultural and creative industries in Gauteng — South Africa’s most
        populous and economically vibrant province. From government entities,
        associations, incubators, and hubs to galleries, academic partnerships,
        and private initiatives, it highlights examples of innovative
        infrastructure and programming that are strengthening the sector. While
        not exhaustive, the project offers a snapshot of the creative ecosystem,
        showing how research can be translated into digital tools that extend
        accessibility and foster new connections.

        In 2025 I created a custom-coded portfolio and archive for artist and
        textile designer Ditiro Mashigo. Ditiro is someone I’ve had the honour
        of working with on a few occasions, and when she asked me to design and
        build her online portfolio, I knew it had to reflect the depth of her
        practice – a critical analysis of African aesthetics through the lenses
        of memory, womanhood, spirituality, and cosmology. I wanted to translate
        these themes into an interactive experience. The idea of 3D orbs on a
        draggable canvas became the conceptual backbone – each orb representing
        a facet of her creative output. I built the site with React and
        Three.js, a library I had always admired from afar (NASA uses it in some
        of its online visualisations, which first inspired me to learn to code).
        For a long time, Three.js felt completely out of reach – the kind of
        tool reserved for “real developers.” But through this project, I
        realised how accessible and transformative it could be.

        I founded and conceptualised Art After Baby in 2023 as an INCCA project
        to support artists who are mothers, parents, and those who have
        experienced loss related to caregiving. The initiative grew out of my
        own awareness of how the art world often overlooks the realities of
        parenting, and how difficult it can be to balance care responsibilities
        with a sustainable creative practice. For the first edition, we launched
        an open call inviting visual artists juggling art-making with
        caregiving. Each selected artist received a living wage for two months,
        as well as an artist fee to participate in a two-person exhibition at
        Keyes Art Mile in Johannesburg. In 2025, we realised the second edition
        of the project at Victoria Yards, this time mentoring artists through
        the process of producing their first solo exhibitions. Both editions
        were supported by the National Arts Council South Africa (NAC) through
        the Presidential Employment Stimulus Programme (PESP 4 and 5).",

        <i>Tiny letters for mothers</i> is a non-commercial, collaborative
        project I co-created with Dr Dee Marco after we worked together on the
        curatorial initiative Art After Baby. We shared a strong interest in
        finding new ways to surface the small, often unspoken stories of early
        parenting—moments that are powerful and universal, but which often go
        unrecorded.The first “data story” asks mothers and parents worldwide to
        recall either their birth story or their first days at home with a new
        baby. Using D3.js, I developed an interactive data visualisation that
        transforms these memories into portraits of language, frequency, and
        tone – showing how data can hold complexity, nuance, and emotion. It was
        important to us that the technology serve the storytelling, rather than
        strip it away. This project is part of INCCA’s “pay it forward”
        imperative, supported in its early stages by the NAC’s PESP 4 award. For
        me, Tiny Letters is as much about collective remembering as it is about
        digital design. It builds a global network of experiences of motherhood
        and parenthood, creating a living archive that values care, resilience,
        and vulnerability.

        In 2025, I contributed a commissioned text on Helena Uambembe’s work{" "}
        <i>Long, Long, Long ago </i>to the catalogue of the 36th Bienal de São
        Paulo. Entitled{" "}
        <i>Not All Travellers Walk Roads – Of Humanity as Practice</i>, the 36th
        edition is led by chief curator Prof. Dr. Bonaventure Soh Bejeng Ndikung
        together with his conceptual team of co-curators Alya Sebti, Anna
        Roberta Goetz and Thiago de Paula Souza, as well as co-curator at large
        Keyna Eleison and strategy and communication advisor Henriette Gallus.
        The exhibition takes its cue from Afrobrazilian poet Conceição
        Evaristo’s enigmatic poem <i>Da calma e do silêncio</i> [Of calm and
        silence]. In new work commissioned for the Bienal, Helena returns to the
        familiar medium of video, where shadow and light interplay with the
        artist’s own transfixing narration. The work is introduced through a
        newer dimension of her practice: a large-scale painting at the entrance
        to the film booth.

        Helena Uambembe’s presentation at Haus der Kunst for ars viva 2025 marks
        a bold evolution in her practice, as she debuts works from a new series
        titled <i>O.o.n.o.o Fever Dreams</i>. In this new series of paintings,
        sculpture and installation, Uambembe probes the psychological impact of
        displacement and collective trauma, particularly through the lenses of
        mass hysteria, fear of witchcraft, and the societal suspicion cast on
        immigrants – especially those from the Global South – amid rising global
        conflict. In a series of hallucinatory paintings, Uambembe introduces a
        searing acid green to her otherwise earthy, monochrome palette,
        heightening the dissonance between beauty and unease. An installation of
        small carved wooden figures arranged among layers of copper gauze evokes
        a haunting spectral presence despite their diminutive size. In a second
        installation, a cell padded in jungle green, accompanied by a scratchy
        soundtrack, lures the viewer in through the disquieting question
        scrawled on the wall outside: “But are you awake?” Drawing from the
        experiences of her Angolan community, who fled the civil war and were
        resettled in Pomfret, South Africa – a relocation inextricably linked to
        the South African military’s 32 Battalion – Uambembe explores the
        fraught intersection of shared trauma and accusations of witchcraft. In
        this context, even appearing together in dreams, or deaths caused by
        illness or war, could give rise to suspicion. Her work intertwines
        intimate personal histories with a broader meditation on how fear of the
        unknown continues to shape both global realities and psychic landscapes.

        In 2024, I worked with Something Good Studio on a brand merger and full
        website redesign, consolidating their Shopify platform and helping them
        better tell the story of their artist-led collaborations. I continue to
        work with them as an art liaison, offering digital solutions that sit at
        the intersection of design, storytelling, and commerce. My approach with
        this project was not only technical – implementing responsive design,
        refining the product catalogue, and optimising the online store – but
        also conceptual. I wanted the digital space to reflect their ethos of
        slow design and sustainable production, while also giving clarity and
        confidence to the user experience. Beyond the build itself, I’ve
        supported the studio in organising their projects, helping to share
        their growing network of South African and international artist
        collaborations. This project reflects something central to my own
        practice: using code, written word and creative strategy together to
        help independent cultural initiatives carve out a presence that feels
        both functional and true to their values.
