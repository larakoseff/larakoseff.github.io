                <h3>Independent art projects</h3>
                In 2018 I embarked on an independent career and built various platforms, both online and offline,
                that supported independent and emergent practice, including <a
                    href="https://bubblegumclub.co.za/art/offsetculture-art-launches-poster-series-pictorial-nerve/"
                    target="_blank">offset culture</a> and the <a href="https://underlineprojects.art/"
                    target="_blank">UNDERLINE show</a>, which was received to much acclaim and led to myself and
                co-founder Londi Modiko to being featured on the <a
                    href="https://www.apollo-magazine.com/lara-koseff-and-londi-modiko-apollo-40-under-40-africa-the-business/"
                    target="_blank">Apollo 40 Under 40
                    Africa</a> list in 2020. During this time curatorial projects include LOST LOVER at <a

                2019. In 2020, with Modiko and
                Nthabiseng Mokoena, I co-founded <a href="https://incca.org.za/" target="_blank">INCCA (Independent
                    Network for Contemporary Culture & Art)</a>, a non-profit company that aims to foster
                independent cultural practice. I continue to work on INCCA projects and offer content, digital
                communication and project management for the platform on an ongoing basis.

                <h3>Web & coding projects</h3>
                I completed a 6-month Software Development
                bootcamp in 2023 at <a href="https://www.codespace.co.za/" target="_blank">CodeSpace</a>, and am
                currently deepening my skills in <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank>">React</a>
                and exploring libraries such as <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> and <a
                    href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>. As part of the bootcamp, we started with the
                basics, creating games and animations in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/861818624/"
                    target="_blank"> Scratch</a>, a coding community and language designed for children. We then built
                our own digital resumes (what you're currently browsing, with some upgrades), as well as deep diving
                into JavaScript (involving much debugging) and eventually built our <a
                    href="https://subtle-croissant-aa7f9d.netlify.app/" target="_blank">own podcast sites </a>using
                React and loading data from an API. Prior to learning how to code, I used website builders
                such as WordPress and Cargo to create sites for my own initiatives such as <a
                    href="https://underlineprojects.art/" target="_blank">UNDERLINE projects</a> and <a
                    href="https://incca.org.za/" target="_blank">INCCA</a>, as well as for others, including <a

                    Contemporaneity</a> and <a href="https://macrobioticeating.co.za/" target="_blank">Macrobiotic

                I have edited, compiled and contributed to numerous
                publications on art and together with Londi Modiko have written regularly for
                publications such as the <i>Sunday Times</i> in South Africa about the
                local art industry. I have also researched and presented academic
                papers concerning the art market and cultural economics at the
                <a href="https://www.christies.com/about-us/press-archive/details?PressReleaseID=9342"

                in 2015, both in New York City. My paper presented at the CAA
                conference on the economic viability of new media art in South
                Africa was published in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19301944.2016.1205383"

                <h3>SOUTH SOUTH</h3>
                In 2020 I rejoined <a href="http://www.goodman-gallery.com" target="_blank">Goodman Gallery</a> to
                oversee the evolution of the <a href="https://south-south.art/" target="_blank">SOUTH SOUTH</a> project,
                which – in collaboration with galleries in Brazil, Mexico City, Uganda, India, Tokyo and New York City -
                was established as an online community, an anthology, an archive and a resource focussed on the Global
                South. Prior to a year-long maternity hiatus I worked on the platform as a project manager, rejoining as
                project coordinator in early 2022 , and intermittently consult on the initiative. My work on SOUTH SOUTH
                has included liaising with galleries, curators, collectors and artists, overseeing the website
                development and content and roll out and marketing of a regular programme, including special projects in
                São Paulo and Johannesburg.

                <h3>Goodman Gallery</h3>
                From 2010-2018, I worked at <a href="http://www.goodman-gallery.com" target="_blank">Goodman Gallery</a>
                Johannesburg, primarily in a curatorial, communications and editorial capacity and as a liaison for over 15 artists.
                Here I was, as Latin America liaison, involved in the inception of SOUTH SOUTH, a curatorial initiative
                exploring connections within and constructions of the Global South. My experience at Goodman ranged
                extensively and included: managing and curating exhibitions, events and other projects; managing artist relationships, production and inventory; writing,
                editing and designing various material from press releases to catalogues and books; managing the gallery brand, communications, aspects of the website and archive;
                conceptualising and writing all art fair applications;
                managing and attending art fairs (Paris Photo; Frieze New York and London; SP-Arte); developing and
                expanding networks with writers, curators, collectors and museum professionals; hosting museum
                delegations and designing itineraries including studio visits and special presentations; research on and developing relationships with new
                artists.
